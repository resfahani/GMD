#Ground_Motion_Autoencoder

##Dimensionality of ground motion data 

Construction of a Neural Network Autoencoder to map the Fourier spectral amplitudes of ground motion triggered by earthquakes to a low dimensional manifold and sampling from low dimensional manifold to generate ground motion data.
